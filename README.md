# CMIS 1101 Resources

Supplementary resources for learning about the basics of MS Office. In the two folders in this repository, you will find:
<ul>
<li> <b>In-Class Examples:</b> files that we will use for the in-class exercises and examples. </li>
<li> <b>PowerPoint Slides:</b> slides that I will use for lecture content, this is mostly around the database and SQL content. </li>
</ul>

These things are subject to change, and the numbering may not perfectly match what we do, but all the resources that I'll use for in-class examples and lecture content will be in this repository.
