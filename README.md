# CMIS 1101 Resources

Supplementary resources for learning about the basics of MS Office. In the two folders in this repository, you will find:
<ul>
<li> <b><a href="https://github.com/AkeemSemper/Office_Basics_Resources/tree/main/In-Class%20Example%20Files">In-Class Example Files:</a></b> files that we will use for the in-class exercises and examples. </li>
<li> <b><a href="https://github.com/AkeemSemper/Office_Basics_Resources/tree/main/In%20Class%20PowerPoint%20Slide%20Decks">In-Class PowerPoint Slide Decks:</a></b> slides that I will use for lecture content, this is mostly around the database and SQL content. </li>
</ul>

These things are subject to change, and the numbering may not perfectly match what we do, but all the resources that I'll use for in-class examples and lecture content will be in this repository.
